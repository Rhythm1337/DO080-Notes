# Containers:
**Container** is a running instance of a **Container Image**.
A *Container Image** is a single file (tarball), loaded with metadata, that has all the files needed by your application.
The **Entry Point** is the command used to start your **Container**.

Technologies Powering Containerization ----> Kernel namespaces, SECComp, SELinux, Control Groups(cgroups).
These are in-built into the linux kernel

Kernel namespaces:
It represents a partition or a boundary. For example namespace1 can only access the files, process and memory which is specified in metadata.

Control Groups(cgroups):
They help us set limitations with our system resources. For example namespace1 those processes are allowed to access 1GB Memory and 1 CPU.

SECComp:
Think of it as a allow and a deny list of those system cores that are going to be allowed from your namespaces

Think your Entry point as systemd, your entry point can be any process
